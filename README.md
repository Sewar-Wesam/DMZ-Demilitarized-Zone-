## What is DMZ?   
DMZ typically is a VLAN ( Virtual LAN ) instead of physical network. DMZ can be considered as a separate subnetwork, it is used to host the services that need to be accessable from the internet like ( Web, Email, DNS ).  
## Why do we use DMZ?   
In general, DMZ is used for two main goals:   
- Isolation: To isolate the internal network from the public servers, this will prevent from the risk if the public servers are compromised.
- Security : DMZ adds layer of security, so if the attackers breach a server in DMZ, he needs to check another measures like Firewall's rule table to access the internal network.
